 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.012   TIME= 13:33:26
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.044   TIME= 13:33:26
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.137   TIME= 13:33:26
 SOLID186 wedges are recommended only in regions of relatively low       
 stress gradients.                                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.293   TIME= 13:33:27
 Material number 12 (used by element 24749 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     108.343   TIME= 13:39:39
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 1040%.     
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
