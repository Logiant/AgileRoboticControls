 It is highly recommended to use the auto contact setting option by      
 issuing CNCHECK,AUTO command for this problem in order to achieve       
 better convergence.

 The Sparse Matrix solver is currently running in the optimal            
 out-of-core memory mode.  This memory mode achieves a good balance of   
 memory usage and hard drive usage in order to obtain an efficient       
 solution time.
