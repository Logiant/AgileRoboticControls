 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.153   TIME= 12:46:22
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.215   TIME= 12:46:22
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.340   TIME= 12:46:23
 SOLID186 wedges are recommended only in regions of relatively low       
 stress gradients.                                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.527   TIME= 12:46:23
 Material number 12 (used by element 31613 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.853   TIME= 12:46:23
 ANSYS has found the contact pairs have similar mesh patterns.  ANSYS    
 will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.853   TIME= 12:46:23
 The geometric gap/penetration may be too large.  Increase pinball       
 radius if it is a true geometric gap/penetration.  Decrease pinball if  
 it is a false one.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.951   TIME= 12:46:27
 The geometrical gap may be too large.  Increase pinball if it is a true 
 geometrical gap.  Decrease pinball if it is a false one.                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     242.597   TIME= 12:59:27
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 806%.      
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
