 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.791   TIME= 14:52:05
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.838   TIME= 14:52:05
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.009   TIME= 14:52:05
 SOLID186 wedges are recommended only in regions of relatively low       
 stress gradients.                                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.274   TIME= 14:52:05
 Material number 8 (used by element 36274 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.928   TIME= 14:52:09
 ANSYS has found the contact pairs have similar mesh patterns.  ANSYS    
 will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.928   TIME= 14:52:09
 The geometric gap/penetration may be too large.  Increase pinball       
 radius if it is a true geometric gap/penetration.  Decrease pinball if  
 it is a false one.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      18.034   TIME= 14:52:31
 The geometrical gap may be too large.  Increase pinball if it is a true 
 geometrical gap.  Decrease pinball if it is a false one.                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      18.065   TIME= 14:52:34
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.
