%Function used to simulate the robotic leg
%Inputs:
%Link1, Link2 - .stl files
%L1, L2 - the length of each link
%L12 - the distance along L1 where L2 is attached
%L21 - the distance along L2 where L1 is attached
%P1x, P1y - the ground location of piston 1
%P12 - the distance of piston 1's attachment point on link 2
%p21 - the distance of piston 2's attachment point on link 1
%p22 - the distance of piston 2's attachment point on link 2
function y=LegModel(Link1, Link2, L1, L2, L12, L21, P1x, P1y, P11, P21, P22)
