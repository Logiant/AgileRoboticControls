function [F,V,C] = cad2mat(filename)
% CAD2MATDEMO, a demonstration of importing 3D CAD data into Matlab.
% To get CAD data into Matlab, the process is:
%
% 1) Export the 3D CAD data as an ASCII STL (or Pro/E render SLP) file.
% 2) This Matlab routine reads the CAD data
% 3) Once read, the CAD data is rotated around a bit.
%
% Program has been tested with: AutoCAD, Cadkey, and Pro/Engineer.
% Should work with most any CAD programs that can export STL.
% 
% Format Details:  STL is supported, and the color version of STL
% that Pro/E exports, called 'render.'  The render (SLP) is just 
% like STL but with color added.
% 
% Note: This routine has both the import function and some basic
% manipulation for testing.  The actual reading mechanism is located
% at the end of this file.

% Used to create Matlab patches of CAD 3D data.
